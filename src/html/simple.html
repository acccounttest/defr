    <p><label><input name="autoload" type="checkbox" value="1" onclick="document.cookie='defr='+this.checked*1"/> Activate autoloading of the deferred assets</label> and reload the page while watching your network tab. You should see that the four assets are loaded <strong>after the DOMContentLoaded event</strong> (as opposed to the <code>@@defr</code> library itself). This is the effect of deferred loading.</p>
